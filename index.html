                        <p>
                            I ran into some old friends from school this weekend, while I was out with my
                            friends. One of the first questions out of our mouths were "What are you up to
                            these days, where are you working?" Former design students ask their friends this
                            question with a slightly worried look, because almost everyone graduated jobless,
                            and our employment has ranged from retail to super sweet full time dream jobs.
                            You don't want to bum out your talented classmates by reminding them that
                            because of this economy they get to beg for jobs they are overqualified for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, I told them I was freelancing, and living the dream, and they laughed
                            because you don't say a phrase like living the dream seriously. I thought about it
                            more though, and I kind of am. I am having an amazing time doing this, and I'm
                            actually starting to feel successful! Which is something I haven't felt in a while.
                            Also, all this working means that soon I will actually have some new projects to
                            show you guys - I can't wait!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Anyway, that's not what this post is about. This post is about my obsession with
                            office supplies. This has already been pretty well documented, but gosh, I don't
                            know, something about the fact that the back to school display is in full swing at
                            target, and move in weekend was just here makes me in the mood to find some new
                            stuff for my office. I still think it is the tragedy of my life that I don't have to go
                            back to school shopping any more. Something about those fresh notebooks and
                            binders, all full of potential, and those post it notes just waiting for my notes and
                            to-dos just left my heart aflutter.
